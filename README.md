# So I'm practicing my C lessons on how to build my own shell by myself
## After so many learnings and trial and errors, I've decided to take it one step at a time
> Would be covering lots of concepts like:
- Processes
- creating a process
- waiting for a process to return
- breaking commands into tokens (parsing)
- Mapping commands to appropriate command PATH
and more!
